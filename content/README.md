# Content Template

This directory contains example content structure for your Quartz site.

## Structure

```
content/
├── index.md          # Homepage
├── about.md          # About page
└── README.md         # This file
```

## Customization

Replace the example content with your own:
- Edit `index.md` for your homepage
- Add new markdown files for additional pages
- Organize content in subdirectories as needed

## Multi-language Support

If you installed the multilang package:
- Create `content/en/` for English content
- Create `content/ca/` for Catalan content
- Create `content/es/` for Spanish content
- Or configure your own locales in `scripts/build-multilang.mjs`
