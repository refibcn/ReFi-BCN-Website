## When Working in This Repository

**This is a Quartz Website Repository for:**
- Publishing ReFi Barcelona's public web presence
- Showcasing activities, events, and team
- Providing information and calls-to-action
- Connecting the community

**Repository Workflow:**
1. Edit content files in `content/` folder
2. Edit styles in `quartz/styles/custom.scss`
3. Preview locally: `npx quartz build --serve` (http://localhost:8080)
4. Commit and push to `main` branch
5. GitHub Actions automatically deploys to refibcn.cat
6. Changes live in ~1-2 minutes

**Always Check First:**
- Is the design consistent with existing patterns?
- Does the content align with ReFi Barcelona's mission?
- Is the styling following the design system (colors, spacing, boxes)?
- Will this work responsively on mobile?

**Content Management:**
- **Primary File:** `content/index.md` contains all homepage sections
- **Images:** Store in `quartz/static/` folder
- **Styling:** Centralized in `quartz/styles/custom.scss`
- **Quick Preview:** `npx quartz build --serve` shows changes immediately

**Design Consistency:**
- Use CSS variables for colors (never hardcode colors)
- Follow box component pattern for new sections
- Maintain 3rem vertical spacing between sections
- Test responsive behavior at mobile widths
- Keep hover states consistent (transform translateY, color changes)

**Deployment Process:**
- **Automatic:** Push to main → GitHub Actions builds → Deploys to refibcn.cat
- **Manual Trigger:** Can also run GitHub Actions workflow manually
- **Domain:** Custom domain via Cloudflare DNS (CNAME → refibcn.github.io)
- **SSL:** Enforced HTTPS via GitHub Pages + Cloudflare
